            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I have obſerv'd <hi>(Heare O ye heavens, and be aſtoniſht)</hi> how the God of all grace hath ſuffer'd in his Glory, Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, and Providence; would to God I might not ſay in his very eſſence and being; by a generation of men, who are

                        <p>Firſt, If you would have a calm paſſage of Comfort here, and arrive at the Haven of eternal Reft here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, you muſt ſail by the Card and Compaſs of Religion. As God is the fountain of love, nay, <hi>love it ſelf,</hi> ſo he muſt be the principal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our affections: <hi>If He</hi> be that third and common perſon in whom we meet, we ſhall ſoon agree amongſt our ſelves. Then we ſhall derive from him, as by reflection, continual ſupplies of love. Your love to each other will be <hi>freſh eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry morning,</hi> when the <hi>Springs</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>are in,</hi> and from <hi>him:</hi> when tis bottom'd upon conſcience to Gods Ordinance, and flows from the Ocean of his Love. Religion ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a bond, becauſe by it we are bound to God; and this doth alſo binde us one to another; without this Cement we ſhall ſoon ſhatter, and like ſo much ſand fall aſunder; even as the members of our bodies
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105888:167"/>are looſened and disjoynted when they are not compacted, and held together by nerves coming from the Head. Such flames of love, which were never kindled by any ſparks from <hi>Gods Altar,</hi> are like thoſe of <hi>crackling thorns,</hi> quickly out: like thoſe flaſhing Meteors in the ayr, which are as ſoon vaniſht as ſeen; or if you will, like untimely bloſſoms, ſoon blaſted. When Beauty proves the only motive and cord of love; if ſickneſs draw her pale Mantle over thoſe Roſie Cheeks, or Age make ſurrows in thoſe faces. (Alas) that cord will crack; then Beauty and Love will be cancel'd, and expire together. If riches raiſe our affections, if our hearts are intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with a Love potion of molten gold, and our Livers ſmitten with the darts of Dowry, when theſe ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery companions ſhall <hi>make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wings, and flie away,</hi> ſuch love will go for company: but thoſe that marry <hi>in Domino, in the Lord,</hi> in all changes their love will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable; and like the righteous themſelvs,<note place="margin">Pſal. 92.14.</note> ſhal bring forth moſt fruit
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105888:167"/>of love in old age. There was good reaſon why St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Col. 3. did in the former part of the chapter teach men their duty to God, before he inſtructs them concerning their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Relations, becauſe he knew that husbands and wives, fathers and children, could not diſcharge their devoir and duty one to another, without being firſt initiated, and principled in the fear and ſervice of God. Give me a Servant that is truly Religious, and I dare warrant him a <hi>true Iſraelite,</hi> and become bound for his ſidelity. How can ſuch Courtiers be faithful to me, ſaid the Emperour, who are faithleſs to their Maker? If <hi>Abraham</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <hi>his houſhold after him,</hi> and <hi>teach the members thereof to keep the way of the Lord;</hi> we may well expect to hear of an humble, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient <hi>Sarah,</hi> a dutifull <hi>Iſaac,</hi> a wiſe and faithful <hi>Eleezar.</hi> When I ſee the Scepter of Religion lifted up in any Family, O what a luſtre doth it put upon it! thats more glorious then all the buildings, and better fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture then the richeſt Tapeſtry. I
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105888:168"/>cannot forbear to ſay, Either <hi>peace to that houſe,</hi> or elſe, <hi>How beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are thy Tents, O Jacob, and thy gates O Iſrael!</hi> when I ſhall ſee Reformation enter at this door, and begin at private families, then, and not till then, ſhall I hope to ſee a bleſſed Church, and a flouriſhing State. Take this adviſe therefore from your unworthy Servant; ſet up the Standard of Piety in your Chambers, Cloſets, and Heart; Let all the houſes of your abode, be ſo many Oratories, conſecrated to Heaven, and perſumed with the incenſe of daily prayers: Chooſe all your Servants by this <hi>Shibboleth;</hi> let them ſpeak this dialect, and wear this Livery; that <hi>as Laban proſpered the better for Jacobs ſake,</hi> ſo may you for theirs. Profane Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants will demoliſh the ſtrongeſt walls, and looſen the firmeſt raf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and bring the greateſt houſes to ruine. Seaſon the tender years of your children (when God ſhall ſend you thoſe ſweet pledges of his love) with gratious indowments, that ſo <hi>they may grow up as the young
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105888:168"/>plants</hi> and <hi>be as the poliſht corners of the Temple:</hi> Let your reſolution be that of <hi>Joſhuahs, We and our houſholà will ſerve the Lord.</hi> So ſhall your names, and memories be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balmed in the ſucceeding generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of poſterity, better then with all the ſpices of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and your family ſhall be built upon ſo ſure foundations, <hi>that</hi> like <hi>Mount Sion</hi> it <hi>ſhall never be moved.</hi> Though our houſes were as lofty as the Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mids, and we could build our neſts in the clouds, yet ſin will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them, and bring them tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling down, even as the <hi>worm did the gourd of Jonah,</hi> or the Beetle the eggs of the Eagle, though laid in the lap of <hi>Jupiter.</hi> But if <hi>you honour God, God will honour you:</hi> He ſhall ſet you beyond the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot of men, and devils; all the Furies in Hell ſhall not be able to imbitter your joys, nor eclipſe the Sun of your comforts.</p>
                        <q>
                           <l>Stand in this poſture towards the Deity;</l>

                        <p> Secondly, Study each others tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and ſtrive to comply with the bent of one anothers minds. This will create a ſweet harmony, and ſympathie of Affections: for there are ſeveral complexions of the minde as well as of the body. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it the greateſt victory to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come your own paſsions, and the moſt generous magnanimity to yield to, and conceal one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers infirmities. Where iron meets with iron, there is claſhing; but if iron fall upon a pack of wool, there is no noiſe at all; ſo controverſies die when they meet with <hi>ſoft an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,</hi> and are not banded up and down by indiſcretion on both ſides. It was well ſaid of him that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed he would beat his Servant, had he not been angry; and it was as well done of another, that would never take notice of any provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, before he had firſt told over all the Letters of the Alphabet; knowing that time will mitigate, and cool the boyling ſurges of unruly paſſions. Tis even unnatural to ſee how ſome Couples do even cut and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105888:169"/>mangle their own fleſh, by vexing each other. The very Heathens threw out of doors the galls of ſuch Beaſts as were killed in ſacrifice at Weddings, to ſignifie that no bitterneſs ſhould remain there.</p>
                        <p>But I forget my ſelf. I am not writing to ſome <hi>Nabal,</hi> ſome <hi>Zip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porah,</hi> or <hi>Xantippe,</hi> but a pair of ſweet Conſorts, who have but one ſoul divided into both their bodies. I ſee no cranny of ſuſpition, I fear none; yet men gird their ſwords about them, though they fear no enemy; and tis no abſurdity to hear a Lecture of Phyſick in perfect health: Theſe directions are not for the curing of maladies, but to prevent them. Pardon me you gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant hearts! if obſerving many Noble Families in this Nation (which is not the leaſt reproach of our Native Countrey) to be even torn, and rent aſunder with Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick diſcords, I wiſh unity, and laſting joys, without any diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to your ſelves. Alas! what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper will there be in hands, feet, and other members, when the very
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105888:170"/>vitals themſelves are peſtered, and ſwollen with ill humors? what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, and confuſion will there be in the inferiour orbs, and wheels, children and ſervants, when the <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> and chief Spring it ſelf, Husbands and Wives are out of tune with continual jarring? What peace, what goodneſs is to be lookt for in ſuch Houſes, where Maſters and Dames lay the <hi>black rods of jangling,</hi> and daily examples of naughtineſs before their ſeveral Relations, and make them to ſin as it were by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity?</p>
                        <p>Give me leave to ſpeak a word or two to you apart, and then I ſhall no longer interrupt your ſweet imbraces.</p>
                        <p>SIR, Me thinks I can be as bold with you as if we were ſtill reading Lectures together; and indeed your humility is the ſame as it was then in your minority; ſo far is the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of your birth, and fortune, from ſwelling you up with the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Ambition. I ſhall not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105888:170"/>trouble you with rules of Frugality, or take upon me to direct you how to manage and ſteward that large portion of Temporals, which the great GOD hath caſt into your lap. Only conſider, the greater your portion is, the greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and opportunity you have in your hands of doing good, in feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hungry, and promoting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and the greater ſhall be your reward, or puniſhment ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day. As you are free from the baſeneſs, and <hi>idolatry</hi> of Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice; ſo men in your condition who are full of earthly comforts, have need ſometimes of ſeaſonable, and faithfull Memento's, that <hi>Satan</hi> tempt them not to ſplit againſt the other Rock, or turn aſide to the other Tropike of waſting and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality. This age is not <hi>ignorant of his wiles</hi> herein: He paints, and dimples the face of pleaſures, and ſends his Emiſſaries, and Proctors, I mean, evil Companions to intice and allure them, to gaming, intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, luxury, and to follow fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtick faſhions, untill they hazard
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105888:171"/>the ruine of their eſtates, and ſouls to boot. How many are there in every County, who received large patrimonies from their forefathers, and yet have tranſmitted and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed nothing but beggery to their poſterity? I was once almoſt tempted to look upon <hi>Naboth</hi> as another <hi>Nabal,</hi> churliſh and peeviſh in not accepting a <hi>better vineyard from</hi> A hab <hi>for his own, or the worth of it in money;</hi> untill conſulting with other Scriptures, <hi>Numb.</hi> 36.7. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 46.18. I found it was utterly unlawfull for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to alienate the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of their Fathers. Had there been ſuch a Law in <hi>England,</hi> we ſhould not have ſeen ſo many Gentlemen priſoners, and High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born beggars at this day. It is not fear of your ſelf, but indignation to others which hath raiſed me to this pitch: next, I ſhall return to what concerns your ſelf.</p>
                        <p>Sir, your extraction is very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, your Allies noble, your edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ingenuous; and you have met with a Lady in all theſe like your
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105888:171"/>ſelf: Now I need not tell you, that theſe thoughts muſt needs prompt you on to generous, and honorable enterprizes; <hi>Shall ſuch a one as I flie?</hi> ſaid <hi>Nehemiah:</hi> ſhall ſuch a one as I do any thing ignoble, and ſtain the fame of my Anceſtors? may you ſay. Nay, what was not unſeemly when a ſingle perſon, may no ways be expedient now; for Marriage puts an addition of Honour upon the greateſt <hi>Hero. Marriage is honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in all men:</hi> ſome of the very <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> marry at ſeven years of age (if their own Stories deceive me not) leſt they ſhould be ſo unhappy as to die before they partake of that bleſſedneſs: others have a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, that if any die before Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, they procure ſome mans ſon or daughter to be matched to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty departed, accounting the ſtate of Marriage, as a means to bring them to happineſs in another world: you ſee my ſcope; it is to winde you up to excellent imployments, and high atchievements from the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your elevated condition. When the <hi>Romans</hi> beheld the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

Although, when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider your refined parts, your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Library of choice Books not of Romances, but Divinity, and your great induſtry in reading and peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſame, Me thinks I may ſave this labour: you well know, that by Creation you were made A Helper, and my charity tells me, you will always prove ſo, both by your counſels in diſtractions, your mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in proſperity, and cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in any adverſity; that as you are the <hi>delight of your Husbands eyes,</hi> ſo I am aſſured, you will prove <hi>a Crown of honour unto his head.</hi> Thoſe Scripture-terms of <hi>obedience,</hi> and <hi>ſubmiſsion</hi> go harſhly down with ſome lofty ſpirits, who will not take notice, in what ſtate God and nature have placed them in. But you are a Friend of order, and will be contented to move in your own ſphere. Woman at the firſt was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken neither out of the head, nor the feet of <hi>Adam,</hi> but out of his ſide, to ſhew that Husband and Wife ſhould walk hand in hand, in a ſweet
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105888:174"/>equality; but pardon me, I beſeech you for detaining you ſo long from your Honoured Conſort. I will now take my leave of you both, that you may take your <hi>fill of Love</hi> together;

                     <p>O Moſt mercifull God! Thou that art the fountain of all goodneſs, in whom all fulneſs dwels, from whom we acknowledge to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived even all the mercies and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts which we enjoy; Teach us we beſeech thee, to look up towards thee, with hearts brim-full of thankfulneſs for the ſame; and make us look downward upon our ſelves with all care and circumſpection, that propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably to the engagements of thy great Love, we may adorn both our own lives and thy Goſpel. Make us to walk wiſely, ſoberly, and devoutly all our days, that we may ſhine as lights in the World, in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe generation, and may be conſtant and faithfull unto the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

As thou haſt been pleaſed by thy providence to call us into the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable eſtate of Matrimony, ſo do thou ſanctifie us by thy Spirit, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us frames of heart ſuitable and fitting for this condition. Inrich us by
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105888:175"/>thy grace, that we may perform the duties, injoy the comforts, under go the cares, and reſiſt the temptations which accompany this eſtate. Make us the means to further each other in the great buſineſs of our everlaſting ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Grant good god, that as thou haſt plentifully beſtowed on us the gifts of thy lefe hand; ſo thou wouldſt alſo give us the bleſſings of thy right hand; make us as gold try'd in the fire, that we may be rich towards thee: Cloath us with the Wedding garment of thy Sons Righteouſneſs. O let Jeſus Chriſt be made unto us wiſdow; righteouſneſs; ſanctification, and redemption: Be thou, O Lord, a Head and a Husband unto us both; Contract, and eſpouſe us to thy ſelf, by the earneſt and Love-tokens of thy Spirit here, that we may be fully married to thy ſelf in thy own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of glory hereafter, and all this we beg upon the Account of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Amen.</hi>
